# As-related gene databases and ROCker models

This repository contains As-related gene databases and ROCker models, including *aioA*, *arxA*, *arrA*, *arsC1*, *arsC2*, *arsM*, *arsI*, and *arsP* genes. If you have any other questions or needs related to the ROCker models, please don't hesitate to contact us (syzhang@des.ecnu.edu.cn). The databases and ROCker models provided here may only be used for academic exchange and are not permitted for commercial use.

The papers are out at *Microbiome* (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-024-01952-4) and *Environ Sci Technol* (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08620). Please cite the following if you find POCker models helpful for your analyses. 

If you use the databases of *aioA*, *arxA*, *arrA*, *arsC1*, and *arsC2* genes or the ROCker models, please cite the first paper; if you use the databases of *arsM*, *arsI*, and *arsP* genes or the ROCker models, please cite the second paper.
